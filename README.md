# Child_Creation_Helper_Tool
A simple tool for Unity developers to simplify the process of creating child GameObject of multiple selected GameObjects in the scene. This is an initial release, originally created for a personal project. While I'm not an expert in editor scripting, I'm committed to learning and improving it over time.
